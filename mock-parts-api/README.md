# Mock SparePartsAPI

Local HTTP server that simulates the spare-parts catalog used by Session 2.  
No external dependencies — runs on plain Node.js `http`.

## Start

```bash
node mock-parts-api/server.js
# or
npm run mock
```

Default port: **3001**. Override with `MOCK_PORT=<port>`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check + catalog stats |
| GET | `/parts` | Full catalog (17 parts) |
| GET | `/parts/:code` | Single part by code |

## Test it

```bash
# Health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Available part
curl http://localhost:3001/parts/P-SEAL-001

# Unavailable part (triggers 422 in CAP)
curl http://localhost:3001/parts/P-OBS-999

# Unknown part (triggers graceful degradation in CAP)
curl http://localhost:3001/parts/DOES-NOT-EXIST
```
